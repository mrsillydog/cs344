Exercise 9.2
a. Regularizing decreases the number of parameters involved in the model. This makes the model simpler, helping to avoid overfitting and improving efficiency.
b. L1 regularization encourages the weights on parameters to go to 0. This decreases the number of parameters that actually play a role in the model, therefore increasing sparsity.
c. LogLoss: 0.25
   Model Size: 553
   Gamma: 0.85
