    "Introspection would not be a good way for researchers to gain insight into human cognitive processes. While the earliest psychologists were limited to introspection in terms of their techniques to study the mind, modern psychologists and neuroscientists have a much more diverse array of technology and resources to examine human cognition. Introspection has its merits; when a cognitive process is going on, the closest person to understanding it should be the person in whose mind it is occurring. However, all too often this isn’t the case, since the process might be in the person’s subconscious or simply be inaccessible to the subject themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "A neuroscientist or psychologist, on the other hand, can evaluate the process much more empirically and with decreased bias from an external, test-driven perspective. Most of the advancements in neuroscience, such as neuroplasticity and the connection of some processes to their respective parts of the brain, have been found through such methods, not through introspection. However, to go further a new method entirely might be required. We are still no closer to understanding why humans experience the world in the way we do, despite all of our efforts."
