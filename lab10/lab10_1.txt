Exercise 10.1
a. I would rather use Keras. If I were a more experienced model developer and knew how to utilize the greater flexibility of Tensorflow to my advantage, I would probably choose to use it, but as a novice Keras has my vote due to it being significantly simpler to use.
b. 
Task 1: 
dnn_regressor = train_nn_regression_model(
    learning_rate=0.0005,
    steps=2000,
    batch_size=100,
    hidden_units=[20, 5],
    training_examples=training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

Task 2:
Final RMSE (on test data): 106.96
