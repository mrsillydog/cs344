Exercise 7.2

a. Numerical data is data with number values (1, 100.4, 55). Categorical data is data with discrete labels as values ("True" or "False", "Dog" or "Cat" or "Parrot").

b. 

Task 1:

train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00003,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5
)

Task 2:

train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00003,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5,
    input_feature="population"
)

c. Hyper-parameters are parameters which dictate how the machine learning algorithm learns, as opposed to the actual data parameters. Put a different way, hyper-parameters are developer-defined with values such that the regular parameters can be better defined by the machine learning algorithm.

There is no standard tuning algorithm for hyper-parameters, since the effects of various hyper-parameters is data dependent. So the only way to truly test their validity is by testing on the data.
