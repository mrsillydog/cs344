Exercise 7.1

a.
Exercise 1
cities["Begins with San and 50+ sq. miles"] = (cities["City name"].apply(lambda name: name.startswith("San")) & cities["Area square miles"].apply(lambda area: area > 50))
cities

Exercise 2
cities.reindex(np.random.permutation(cities.index + 5))

b. Pandas provides data in a more understandable fashion than NumPy; it provides labeled columns and indexing on the rows, whereas it's very easy to lose track of which column represents what with NumPy. The 2-dimensional DataFrame object is also very convenient.

c. Before random sampling would be one such scenario; therefore, instead of sampling at random indices or risking any organizational non-randomness, one could just randomly reorder the database and take the first X values.
