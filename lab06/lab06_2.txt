Exercise 6.2

1. I want the ML model to predict whether or not an email is spam.
2. My ideal outcome is to discard spam email without discarding non-spam email,
   without the user having to do so manually.
3. A success metric is the number of spam emails properly predicted by the model,
   minus the number of non-spam emails improperly predicted as spam by the model.

   Key Results: Success means consistently correctly predicting 95% or more of 
   spam emails as spam, while predicting less than .01% of non-spam emails as spam. 
   
   Failure means the percentage of emails correctly predicted as spam is no 
   better than current heuristics or the percentage of emails incorrectly 
   labeled as spam is higher than .01%.
4. The output from our ML model will be whether an email is spam or not.

   The output is defined as 1 or 0 (Spam or not spam)
5. The output from the ML model will be made before the email appears in the
   user's inbox.
   The outcome will be used to either place the email in the user's inbox (0)
   or into their Spam folder (1).
6. Hardcoded heuristics: an email is spam if it:
   1) Has non-alphabetical characters in-between alphabetical characters.
   2) Has sexual terms in it.
   3) Has the word "click" in it more than twice.

7. a. My problem is best framed as a binary classification.
   b. My problem already is a binary classification.
8. Inputs will be strings. Outputs will be 1 (spam) or 0 (not spam).
9. The inputs come from each word in the email, as separated by whitespace.
   Each row will be an email, each column will be a string from that email.
10. "cl1ck" "sexy" "click" -> 1 (spam)
